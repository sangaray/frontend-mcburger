        <h2>A Unique Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The team wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation. They wanted to serve burgers, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in every restaurant around de country during the pandemic.
        To achieve this, they chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McBurger but for themselves, together with McBurger. Their philosophy was based on the simple principle of a 3-legged stool: one leg was McBurger franchisees; the second, McBurger suppliers; and the third, McBurger employees. The stool was only as strong as the three legs that formed its foundation.

        <h2>Hamburger University</h2>
        <p>In 2021, the team launched a training program, later called Hamburger University, at a new McBurger restaurant in Córdoba. There, franchisees were trained on the proper methods for running a successful McBurger restaurant. Hamburger U utilized a research and development laboratory in Córdoba to develop new cooking, freezing, storing and serving methods. Today, more than 60 franchisees, managers, and employees have graduated from the program.
